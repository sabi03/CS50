Get a command line input from the user
Check if the input is only one argument so argc == 2
Iterate over input and check if its non negative and if its an integer only,otherwise return 1 error
Convert string to int with atoi
Ask for plaintext input
Print Cyphertext on the screen: ...
Iterate over plaintext via its strlen times, and 
    if ascii between 65-90,isupper thats upper case 
    if ascii between {65...90}+32 islower thats lower case
    if other then just print the plaintext[i]'th character as is
CIPHER
Each cipher character should be equal to (plaintext[i]+key) % 26
as 65 + 25 is 'Z'
26 % 26 is 0 therefore
we can say 0 + 'A'(65) = 'A'(65)
we can say 0 + 's'(97) = 'a'(97)
'A' + 32 = lower character
