HELLO WORLD

# CS50 Harvard Course
This course is designed to give you a really good insight into programming and it was easy...oh, wait....
I mean : this course is AMAZING and it really teaches you, how to think logically. It was very though at times, 
I have spent hours and hours sometimes to solve an issue. 
I have learned how to use Github, Stack Overflow, Amazon Web services and Reddit. I have came in good terms with the terminal as well.
I have learned to code a little in C, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I am very thankful to have been able to take this course. I am also very grateful how much the open source community has helped me and still are.
