HELLO WORLD

# CS50 Harvard Course
This course is designed to give you a really good insight into programming, this course has taught me how to think logically. 
It was very though at times, often I have spent hours and hours to solve a bug, but with time I have found ways to debug and test my code more quickly and efficiently. 
I have learned how to use Github, Stack Overflow, Kaggle, Amazon Web services, Reddit etc. I came in good terms with the terminal as well.
I have written programs in the following languages: C, Python, SQL.

I am very thankful to have been able to take this course. I am also very grateful how much the open source community has helped me to grow as a developer.
